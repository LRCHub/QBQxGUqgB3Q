最高の笑顔で 最期は別れた
繋いだ手のぬくもりは まだ残ってる
少し傷ついた でもまだ行ける
両手に武器をとれ 口笛を吹きながら

Oh I don't care if you diss me
Lalalala.. I don’t miss you, I don’t need you
Lalalala.. Don’t be a fool, Give you a smile
人伝に聞いた 次の当選結果
同時に審査されてたことを知ったよ

今は思い出すだけで 吐き気がするわ
Gonna make you regret not choosing me at the
last minute
Absolutely, make it happen

with me
Oh I don't care if you diss me, yeah
